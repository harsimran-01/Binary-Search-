🎮 Binary Search in Game Development
This project demonstrates the application of the Binary Search algorithm within the context of game development. By integrating binary search into gameplay mechanics and logic, we achieve faster performance and improved user experience, especially in scenarios requiring quick decision-making, range detection, or optimized data lookup.

🚀 Features
🎯 Optimized Game Logic using Binary Search

🔍 Efficient Range Detection (e.g. enemy spawn range, difficulty scaling)

🧠 Ideal for games with sorted data: levels, scores, checkpoints, etc.

⚙️ Custom implementation of Binary Search algorithm

🎨 Modular structure for easy integration into any game engine (e.g. Unity, Phaser, custom React canvas)

🧱 Tech Stack
Language: TypeScript / JavaScript (can be adapted to C#, C++, Python)

Environment: Web (React, Canvas) or Game Engine (Unity/Pygame/etc.)

Algorithm: Classic and modified Binary Search implementations

🧠 Use Cases of Binary Search in Game Dev
Level Scaling: Find the right difficulty settings based on player score

Enemy Spawning: Efficiently determine the spawn point or enemy type

Collision Optimization: Quickly detect objects in sorted arrays of positions

Item Lookup: Fast retrieval in sorted inventory systems

Performance Boost: Reduces linear time complexity to log(n)
